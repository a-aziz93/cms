// That’s where the concept of aSharedFlow comes in. A shared flow exists regardless of whether it is being collected or not. A collector of the shared flow is called a subscriber. All subscribers of a shared flow receive the same sequence of values. It effectively works like a “broadcast channel”, without most of the channel overhead. It makes the concept of a broadcast channel obsolete.
